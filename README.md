# unptrack

unptrack - a particle tracking model, written in Fortran 90, that runs offline and uses flow fields from unstructured mesh hydrodynamic models, such as FVCOM and RiCOM. The model can be used to simulate the dispersion and transport pathways of solute or particulate contaminants, or biological organisms such as plankton and pelagic larvae. Particle behaviours such as chemical decay, particle settling, or vertical migration can be assigned.
